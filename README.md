# Paefax Language Quiz project

This app is part of our final project in our Agile course and Web application course at IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg.

The purpose is to create a complete fullstack app (this being the frontend) for some sort of quiz focused on learning using the Agile software development approach and Scrum. We decided to make a language learning app, taking inspiration from apps like Duolingo and the like.

We use Trello, a Scrum master and development team, with our teacher Kevin as our customer and product owner. Trying our best to follow a professional and structured approach of an agile team with regular sprints (one week sprints), daily-stand-ups, reviews and retrospectives every end of sprint.
